abstract = {Random-vibration fatigue evaluation can be of considerable importance in
the design phase of aerospace structures due to the severe dynamic loads
in service. This paper presents the utilization of modal stress approach
to the issue of structural random-vibration fatigue evaluation.
Prognosis of random fatigue hotspots by using stress mode shapes is
theoretically demonstrated. A two-step procedure is proposed for
computational efficiency. Firstly, modal stress analysis is conducted to
locate the fatigue hotspots in a dynamic structure. Secondly, the
frequency domain-based approach for random fatigue evaluation is
performed at these hotspots, as opposed to the computation of the entire
structure as before. The capability of stress mode shapes to locate
fatigue hotspots is verified by numerical investigations. The finite
element model of a single-lap plate structure containing various opening
holes was constructed for case study. Six elements were identified as
hotspots by using modal stress distributions. Then, random responses and
fatigue evaluation of the entire structure were carried out for
verification. Good agreement was observed between the fatigue damage
contour and the modal stress distributions, which can indicate that the
critical positions predicted by stress mode shapes have good accuracy.
The calculation time and storage space can be significantly reduced by
means of the proposed evaluation procedure. Therefore, the accuracy and
efficiency of utilization of modal stress approach in random fatigue
evaluation can be ensured.},

abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to discuss the recent developments in multi-axial spectral methods, used for estimating fatigue damage of multi-axial random loadings from Power Spectral Density (PSD) data. The difference between time domain and frequency domain approaches in multi-axial fatigue is first addressed, the main advantages of frequency domain approach being pointed out. The paper then critically reviews some categories of multi-axial spectral methods: approaches based on uniaxial equivalent stress (strength criteria, “equivalent von Mises stress”, multi-axial rainflow counting), critical plane criteria (Matake, Carpinteri-Spagnoli, criterion based on resolved shear stress on critical plane), stress-invariants based criteria (Crossland, Sines, “Projection-by-Projection”). The “maximum variance” method and the Minimum Circumscribed Circle/Ellipse formulations defined in the frequency domain are also discussed. The paper critically analyses also non-proportional multi-axial loadings and the role of material fatigue parameters (e.g. S/N curves for bending/torsion) in relation to specific methods. The paper concludes with general comments on advantages and possible limitations in the use of multi-axial spectral methods, with special focus on the assumption of stationarity and Gaussianity in modelling multi-axial random loadings.},

Under such scenario, the frequency domain approach is characterized by interesting features, which support its adoption in alternative or in conjunction with the classic time-domain approach, especially when the frequency domain is applied for the individuation of the component critical locations. The major goal of this paper consists of an overview about the strength and weaknesses of frequency approach with respect to the time domain one by comparing the reference time domain methods with their frequency domain translation. A significant test case development will be shown, representing a classic automotive one (chassis validation).

This paper investigates the use of TFR statistical properties for classification or recognition purposes, focusing on a particular TFR: the spectrogram. From the properties of a stationary process periodogram, we derive the properties of a nonstationary process spectrogram. It leads to transform the TFR to a local statistical features space from which we propose a method of segmentation. We illustrate our matter with first- and second-order statistics and identify the information they, respectively, provide. The segmentation is operated by a region growing algorithm, which does not require any prior knowledge on the nonstationary signal. The result is an automatic extraction of informative subsets from the TFR, which is relevant for the signal understanding. Examples are presented concerning synthetic and real signals.},

@phdthesis{Dirlik_1985,
abstract = {The availability of minicomputers and microprocessors, at a reasonable cost, has provided a significant stimulus in a critical appraisal of fatigue testing and analysis methods. This thesis reviews and extends some of the recent fatigue analysis methods. Two major areas investigated in detail are cycle counting methods and methods for prediction of fatigue life to crack initiation. The three recent counting methods, range-pair, Wetzel's and rainflow, which avoid the distortion and inaccuracy from which the traditional cycle counting methods suffer, are described and compared with each other to find out the similarities and differences between them. It is shown that if a service loading history starts and ends at an extreme peak, then all the three methods give an identical count. All relevant methods for the description of measured service histories are reviewed critically in connection with fatigue life assessment, service history regeneration and simulation. Confidence in the rainflow method for better fatigue life predictions and increased use of analytical methods like Finite Element analysis offering frequency domain information about a component have initiated a search for a link between rainflow counting and the power spectral density of a stationary and ergodic random process. Using a Monte Carlo approach and digital simulation techniques, the thesis presents a link in the shape of a closed-form expression which defines the probability density function of rainflow counted ranges for any given power spectral density. A closed-form expression for the distribution of ordinary ranges is also presented. Methods of predicting fatigue crack initiation life under variable amplitude loading are reviewed. From the basic ingredients of the local-strain approach, various life prediction procedures are assembled methodically with regard to how the local stress and strain are determined for a given load level, how the local stress and strain are linked to the life, and how the mean stress effect is accounted for. Predictions made by these methods are compared with the published test data; however predictions are compared mostly within themselves in order to highlight the differences between methods. It is shown that under certain circumstances, some methods give very erroneous results. A sensitivity analysis is carried out to examine how sensitive various methods are to changes in the material properties. A new procedure of determining the material properties from the experimental data is proposed.},

abstract = {The "equivalent von Mises stress" (EVMS) was first proposed in 1994 by Preumont and co-workers as a frequency domain reformulation of von Mises stress, for the fatigue analysis of vibrating structures under multiaxial random stresses. The EVMS criterion is a simple, but very powerful tool to estimate fatigue damage with time domain analysis of simulated stress histories, or frequency domain evaluation by spectral methods. Despite its simplicity, the EVMS criterion is based on some inherent assumptions, which may lead to inaccurate damage estimations in some particular conditions (e.g. materials with very different axial/bending and torsion S-N curves). This paper aims to derive some analytical expressions to measure the accuracy of EVMS criterion for various combinations of material fatigue properties and loading conditions (e.g. combined axial/bending and torsion loadings). These expressions constitute an original contribution, as similar analytical approaches have not been proposed in literature. The accuracy of EVMS approach is then tested with typical material fatigue properties from literature. The range of applicability of EVMS criterion is then be identified for specified intervals and combinations of S-N parameters.},

abstract = {The aim of this paper is firstly, to provide a concise assessment of some commonly used high-cycle fatigue criteria and secondly, to check their predictive capabilities against synchronous sinusoidal out-of-phase bending and torsion experimental results (i.e. sinusoidal stress signals of the same frequency but with a phase difference). This bending - torsion stress system does not closely represent real load conditions undergone by a machine part. However, it is complex enough to differentiate the various fatigue criteria and to permit a first classification of the approaches examined, according to the accuracy of their predictions. A fatigue criterion recently formulated by the first of the authors is also included in this comparative study. According to this criterion the phase difference in out-of-phase bending and torsion does not affect the fatigue strength corresponding to a very high (theoretically infinite) fatigue life. It is pointed out that this theoretical finding is valid for the category of hard metals for which the ratio of the fully reversed torsion fatigue limit over the fully reversed bending fatigue limit lies in the interval from 1/√3 to approx. 0.8. Experimental results collected from the relevant literature, concerning precisely hard metals, fully support this theoretical finding. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1997 Elsevier Science Limited.

abstract = {In order to control the technique of laser-induced forward transfer (LIFT) in ultrashort regimes, it is necessary to understand the different basic mechanisms involved during the three steps: ablation-transfer-deposition. Back ablation of Cr thin film has been studied and compared to the front ablation of the same film in the same conditions. Experiments have been performed using ultrashort laser pulses (800 nm, 100 fs). The dynamics of the plumes have been monitored with a gated intensified charge coupled device (ICCD) camera. Image analysis gave us indications on the velocity and the composition of the ejected material. A parametric study of the ablation thresholds and ablation dynamics has been carried out as a function of the incident laser fluence and the thickness of the metal layer. These results contribute to optimize a process of LIFT. Transfers of Cr on glass and Silicon were obtained with a good spatial resolution.},

@article{Pitoiset_2001,
abstract = {A B S T R A C T This paper proposes computationally efficient frequency domain formulations for two well-known multiaxial fatigue failure criteria, namely Matake's critical plane criterion and Crossland's criterion. For that purpose, it is shown how fatigue-related variables involved in both criteria can be estimated from the power spectral density matrix of the local stress vector. The finite element model of an example structure is then used to illustrate the application of the proposed frequency domain approaches. It is observed that both frequency domain formulations produce consistent results when compared with those obtained in the time domain from Monte-Carlo simulations of local stress vectors while offering tremendous computer savings. A frequency domain tool indicating whether the principal stress directions do rotate with time or not during the loading at a given location in the structure is also presented.

@incollection{DangVan,
abstract = {Crack initiation under high cycle fatigue is a localized phenomenon that occurs in some highly stressed grains of the metallic material. Therefore, the study of high cycle fatigue problems in a rational way is best performed by the introduction of the mesoscopic scale of material description (i.e. the scale of the metal grains of a metallic aggregate) in addition to the usual macroscopic scale of continuum mechanics. The principles of such a multiscale approach in high-cycle fatigue of metallic structures are presented in this work. The multiscale approach is settled on the assumption that under high-cycle fatigue loading a structure will not be fractured by fatigue if an elastic shakedown state is reached at the macroscopic as well as at the mesoscopic scale. The concept of the fatigue limit criterion coincides thus with the possibility of a cyclically loaded structure to tend to an elastic shakedown state at all scales. Extensions of Melan's elastic shakedown theorem to realistic material behaviour are discussed in this article. These theorems allow an easy estimation of the mechanical parameters at the elastic shakedown state at both the macroscopic and mesoscopic scales. Some examples of application of the extended Melan's theorem are provided. The relationships between mesoscopic and macroscopic quantities are studied within the framework of undamaged as well as damaged materials. In the case of undamaged materials, some additional assumptions allow to link the mesoscopic quantities to the usual (macroscopic) stresses and strains through closed form relationships.},

Several spectral methods are reviewed: the narrow-band approximation, the Wirsching-Light formula, Dirlik's amplitude density, the Zhao-Baker technique, together with an approach recently developed by the authors, as well as a new (completely empirical) method. Analogies and differences amongst all cited methods are emphasised and commented on, such as the dependence existing on particular spectral parameters; general relations amongst bandwidth parameters are given in the Appendix. Numerical simulations are used to judge the accuracy of each method in estimating results from time-domain calculations and an error index is defined to quantify all deviations: the Zhao-Baker, Dirlik's and the new method are seen to be the most precise approaches, as well as the new empirical method. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Fatigue damage is traditionally determined from time signals of loading, usually in the form of stress or strain. This approach is satisfactory for periodic loading but requires very large time records to accurately describe random loading processes. These may prove prohibitive for many finite element analyses especially when modelling dynamic resonance. Alternatively, a compact frequency domain fatigue calculation can be utilised where the random loading and response are categorised using Power spectral density (PSD) functions and the dynamic structure is modelled as a linear transfer function. This paper will review the available methods for performing fatigue analysis from PSDs and shows that the Dirlik method gives the best comparable results with the traditional time domain approaches. It also demonstrates how these techniques can be implemented in the Finite Element environment to rapidly identify critical areas in the structure.},

@article{Lutes_Larsen_single_moment_method_2,
abstract = {The dependence of fatigue damage accumulation on power spectral density (psd) is investigated for Gaussian random processes representing stresses in offshore structures. This involves extensive computer simulation of representative stress time histories and related analyses to predict the time of fatigue failure. The recently introduced single-moment (SM) spectral method is shown to be very attractive for predicting fatigue failure. The SM method predicts the damage accumulation rate based only on a single calculation from the psd curve (a moment integral). The accuracy of the SM method and of other spectral methods is studied by comparing results with ones calculated from the much more expensive alternative of using simulated stress time histories, rainflow analysis, and Palmgren-Miner calculations. The SM method is shown to be even simpler than most spectral methods, and all spectral methods are much simpler than any method involving simulation of stress time histories. The accuracy of the SM method is shown to be quite good for a wide variety of situations. Furthermore, there are situations in which the SM method is significantly more accurate than other simple spectral methods, including the very commonly used Rayleigh approximation. It appears that the SM method may provide a valuable tool for predicting the fatigue life of offshore structures subject to complicated time histories of loading, as is required both in the design of new structures and in the reassessment of aging structures. In order to allow a proper balance between fatigue life and initial cost, there is a need for a fatigue prediction method which is both accurate and easy to apply, and the SM method appears to be adequate on both bases. ?? 1991.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2015 Techno-Press, Ltd. This paper presents a study based on the damage due to the fatigue life of thrust ball bearings using vibratory analysis. The main contribution of this work lies in establishing a relation between modal damping and the rolling contact fatigue damage of the thrust ball bearing. Time domain signals and frequency spectra are extracted from both static and dynamic experiments. The first part of this research consists in measuring the damping of damaged thrust ball bearings using impact hammer characterization tests. In a second part, indented components representing spalled bearings are studied to determine the evolution of damping values in real-time vibration spectra using the random decrement method. Dynamic results, in good agreement with static tests, show that damping varies depending on the component's damage state. Therefore, the method detailed in this work will offer a possible technique to estimate the thrust ball bearing fatigue damage variation in presence of spalling.},

@article{Mrsnik_Slavic_Boltezar_spectral_methods,
abstract = {The characterization of vibration-fatigue strength is one of the key parts of mechanical design. It is closely related to structural dynamics, which is generally studied in the frequency domain, particularly when working with vibratory loads. A fatigue-life estimation in the frequency domain can therefore prove advantageous with respect to a time-domain estimation, especially when taking into consideration the significant performance gains it offers, regarding numerical computations. Several frequency-domain methods for a vibration-fatigue-life estimation have been developed based on numerically simulated signals. This research focuses on a comparison of different frequency-domain methods with respect to real experiments that are typical in structural dynamics and the automotive industry. The methods researched are: Wirsching-Light, the $\alpha$0.75method, Gao-Moan, Dirlik, Zhao-Baker, Tovo-Benasciutti and Petrucci-Zuccarello. The experimental comparison researches the resistance to close-modes, to increased background noise, to the influence of spectral width, and multi-vibration-mode influences. Additionally, typical vibration profiles in the automotive industry are also researched. For the experiment an electro-dynamic shaker with a vibration controller was used. The reference-life estimation is the rainflow-counting method with the Palmgren-Miner summation rule. It was found that the Tovo-Benasciutti method gives the best estimate for the majority of experiments, the only exception being the typical automotive spectra, for which the enhanced Zhao-Baker method is best suited. This research shows that besides the Dirlik approach, the Tovo-Benasciutti and Zhao-Baker methods should be considered as the preferred methods for fatigue analysis in the frequency domain. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

During these periods major progresses in multiaxial fatigue analysis are the consideration of anisotropy of materials and the suggestion of the energy method using Mohr's circles.

@article{Gao_TriModal,
abstract = {In this paper, a procedure for fatigue analysis of a general wide-band stationary Gaussian process is developed in the frequency domain using a trimodal spectral formulation, based on a generalization of the principle proposed by Jiao and Moan for predicting bimodal fatigue damage. The novel method approximates the rainflow cycles with large amplitudes as the sum of the envelopes of the process components. First, the method is derived and the corresponding accuracy is demonstrated for ideal trimodal Gaussian processes whose spectra exhibit peaks at three well separated modes, each assumed to be narrow-banded. Hermite numerical integration method is applied to evaluate the fatigue damage due to a Rayleigh sum distribution since there is no closed-form solution for a random variable which is the sum of more than two Rayleigh random variables. Then, the method is further developed and applied to general wide-band Gaussian processes by dividing the spectrum into three segments with the same variances and calculating the fatigue damage in the same way as for the ideal trimodal processes. Based on extensive time series simulated with spectra of wave- and wind-induced structural responses and with generally defined wide-band spectra, the rainflow cycle counting method has been applied to estimate the fatigue damage in the time domain in order to check the accuracy of the proposed method and other frequency-domain methods. It is found that the narrow-band assumption can be very well made for a process with a Vanmarcke's bandwidth parameter which is less than 0.5. For most of the simulated processes with bandwidth parameters between 0.5 and 0.85, the proposed method slightly overestimates the fatigue damage on average. If the bandwidth is greater than 0.85, the fatigue damage obtained by the trimodal formulation may be significantly overestimated in some cases, however spectra with very high bandwidth parameters might be unrealistic. Anyway, it has been shown that the overestimation can be alleviated by using a formulation with more modes for these cases. Moreover, two empirical formulae for wide-band fatigue damage estimation, one derived by Dirlik and the other proposed by Benasciutti and Tovo, have also been verified to be very accurate but slightly underestimate the fatigue damage for a wide range of the bandwidth parameters considered in this paper. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {A novel testing methodology has been developed to determine the fatigue limit strength of structural materials at high frequencies. The procedure involves the use of a base-excited plate specimen driven into a high frequency resonant mode which allows completion of a fatigue test in a few hours. The use of a step-testing method allows determination of the fatigue limit strength of the material corresponding to a very large number of cycles, 106or 107in this case. The methodology consists of a topological design procedure, incorporating a finite element model, to produce the shape of the specimen necessary to achieve the required stress state/pattern, and a forced vibration-based fatigue procedure for conducting the high cycle fatigue experiments with variable-amplitude loading. The successful application of the methodology is demonstrated by the experimental results from steel, 6061-T6 aluminum, and Ti-6Al-4V plate specimens subjected to fully reversed uniaxial and biaxial bending stress states.

In fact, critical phases of BGAs service life such as launch lead to high cycle fatigue (HCF) failure due to severe random accelerations. To face this problem, designers are still using experimental qualifications based on deterministic timedomain fatigue methods. This work is motivated principally to study the applicability of the principal spectral fatigue models as cost effective alternative to assess BGA HCF. The study includes an assembly made up of a BGA chip and a support board. Finite element spectrum analysis brings out that the fatigue failure is expected to occur at different interconnect locations like for instance a critical solder joint made of a ductile tin-lead alloy. Among all the studied spectral models, it emerges that the Dirlik's fatigue prediction is the most relevant in the typical range of the solder fatigue coefficients. {\textcopyright} (2013) Trans Tech Publications.},

GaN-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have been grown on Si(111) substrates with various reactor pressures for the growth of the GaN nucleation layer (NL) using metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. The influence of the reactor pressure on the GaN NLs and the properties of GaN-based LEDs grown on Si(111) substrates is investigated in detail. It is revealed that crack-free GaN films are grown on the Si(111) substrate. As the reactor pressure for GaN NLs increases from 200 to 600 Torr, the full width at half maximum values of the X-ray diffraction rocking curves for the GaN (0002) and (10¯12) planes decrease from 480 to 351 arcsec, and 868 to 445 arcsec, respectively, and as a result the threading dislocation density is greatly reduced, which is confirmed via the cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy measurement. Subsequently, the relationship between bending and annihilation for dislocations, and the modes for GaN NLs are elucidated. The effect of reactor pressure for the GaN NL growth on the mode of the GaN NL is also systematically studied. Furthermore, the light output power of GaN-based LEDs with GaN NLs grown at a reactor pressure of 500 Torr is greatly improved by 73.66{\%} in comparison to that of GaN-based LEDs with GaN NLs grown at a reactor pressure of 200 Torr.

In particular, this study concentrates on the general problem of directly relating fatigue cycle distribution to the power spectral density (PSD) by means of closed-form expressions that avoid expensive digital simulations of the stress process. At present, all the methods proposed to achieve this objective are based on the use of a single parameter of the PSD. In this work, by numerical simulations and theoretical considerations, it is shown that the statistical distribution of fatigue cycles depends on four parameters of the PSD and the methods proposed in the literature provide reliable results only in particular cases. The proposed approach lays the foundation for a more accurate evaluation of the fatigue cycle distribution. As a first result, a closed-form solution for the case of broad-band processes with a narrow-band time derivative has been obtained in this paper.},

The new proposed spectral method is first validated with experimental data from the literature, concerning bending-torsion random loading, showing a general accuracy. Numerical simulations are next used to generate a wide set of bending-torsion random loading with different correlation degrees, variance ratios and frequency content, in order to further validate the new proposed method. Simulations confirm a general quite good accuracy for PbP spectral method and also emphasize its better precision compared to another spectral method, namely the equivalent von Mises stress approach, developed by Preumont and co-workers. {\textcopyright} 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{review_multiaxial_vibration_hindawi,
abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}A review of past and recent developments in multiaxial excitation of linear and nonlinear structures is presented. The objective is to review some of the basic approaches used in the analytical and experimental methods for kinematic and dynamic analysis of flexible mechanical systems, and to identify future directions in this research area. In addition, comparison between uniaxial and multiaxial excitations and their impact on a structure's life-cycles is provided. The importance of understanding failure mechanisms in complex structures has led to the development of a vast range of theoretical, numerical, and experimental techniques to address complex dynamical effects. Therefore, it is imperative to identify the failure mechanisms of structures through experimental and virtual failure assessment based on correctly identified dynamic loads. For that reason, techniques for mapping the dynamic loads to fatigue were provided. Future research areas in structural dynamics due to multiaxial excitation are identified as (i) effect of dynamic couplings, (ii) modal interaction, (iii) modal identification and experimental methods for flexible structures, and (iv) computational models for large deformation in response to multiaxial excitation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. It has been always a difficult problem about how to predict and evaluate the fatigue life of composite material structure in the academia and engineering. Besides, the vibration fatigue of it has not been deeply developed so far. A typical carbon fibre-reinforced plastic (CFRP) cantilevered laminate specimen was designed in this paper. The vibration fatigue of it under non-Gaussian vibration load was studied through the vibration testing in a close-loop controlled vibration test system. A method of monitoring the fatigue damage accumulation of carbon fibre-reinforced composites was proposed and verified. The experimental results show that the CFRP structure will suffer vibration fatigue under the realistic random load. Compare with the Gaussian vibration load, the non-Gaussian load has a significant influence on the vibration fatigue life of composite material structure.},

@article{RainflowGabriel,
abstract = {Most fatigue loaded structural components are subjected to variable amplitude loads which must be processed into a form that is compatible with design life calculations. Rainflow counting allows individual stress cycles to be identified where they form a closed stress-strain hysteresis loop within a random signal, but inevitably leaves a residue of open data points which must be post-processed. Comparison is made between conventional methods of processing the residue data points, which may be non-conservative, and a more versatile method, presented by Amzallag et al. (1994), which allows transition cycles to be processed accurately. This paper presents an analytical proof of the method presented by Amzallag et al. The impact of residue processing on fatigue calculations is demonstrated through the application and comparison of the different techniques in two case studies using long term, high resolution data sets. The most significance is found when the load process results in a slowly varying mean stress which is not fully accounted for by traditional Rainflow counting methods.},

abstract = {During hurricane events, additional damages to existing bridge details might be accumulated from the large stress cycles generated by the non-stationary wind and dynamic vehicle loads. The environmental corrosion could also reduce the structural fatigue strength. Based on the non-stationary wind field modeling techniques and the vehicle-bridge-wind dynamic analysis framework, this paper initiates a fatigue damage assessment of existing bridges with corrosion under vehicle and non-stationary extreme hurricane wind loads. The non-stationary hurricane wind is simulated as a summation of time-varying mean and fluctuating non-stationary components with a time-varying spectrum. Dynamic stress histories are obtained by solving the vehicle-bridge-wind dynamic system. The rain flow counting method is used to obtain the stress ranges and numbers of stress cycles. The corrosion induced fatigue strength degradation is included in the analysis. Numerical examples of an existing long span bridge under simulated non-stationary hurricane winds and vehicles are presented to demonstrate the effects of the dynamic loads and corrosions on the fatigue life estimation of existing bridges.},

@article{vibration_fatigue_multiaxial_testing,
abstract = {The work reported in this paper compared the fatigue damage accumulated under uni-axial loading (a procedure promoted by the vibration testing standards) to that induced by multi-axial loading. The comparison was performed for a helicopter structural element (the flare dispenser bracket of the self-defensive system's Chaff), which is exposed to the particular combination of wide-band random with sinusoidal vibrations, which is characteristic to the helicopter dynamic environment. The evaluation of the fatigue damage induced by these loads requires the calculation or measurement of the structure's dynamic response in terms of stresses or strains, and the application of the appropriate methodology to this response. In this work, dynamic response was calculated in the frequency domain based on the relations between the power spectral density matrixes of the excitations to that of the responses for a linear system. The transfer matrix that relates the excitation to the responses was evaluated numerically. The power spectral densities of the responses evaluated at different locations on the structure were used in the determination of the responses' statistics (the counting of the loading cycles), which, combined with an appropriate physics of failure model (fatigue model), enabled the evaluation of the accumulated fatigue damage. The uni-axial-induced fatigue was evaluated from vibration tests of the kind promoted by military standards (it is assumed that axis-by-axis loading is cumulatively equal to multi-axial loading), and compared to that evaluated by analysis for the multi-axial loading. Also a numerical comparison of the effects of the two kinds of loading was performed. The results showed that the error of uni-axial testing varied for a wide range of parameters. The work led to the conclusion that simultaneous multi-axis vibration testing can improve significantly the laboratory's vibration simulation realism. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Bouyssy_1993,
abstract = {For structural components under random loading, realistic fatigue life predictions require a damage accumulation law together with a cycle counting method. If the classical, linear and memory-less summation rule according to Palmgren/Miner is adopted and the underlying stress process is ergodic substantial simplifications can be reached. From experiments and certain theoretical considerations, so-called rainflow range or local range counting appears most appropriate. Even if the underlying is a Gaussian process, easy analytical solutions are at most available for special types of processes. Therefore, counting usually must be done numerically at observed or artificial stress histories which is extremely time consuming. But a number of approximations exist. Several of them are reviewed and tested against simulations for a variety of bandwidths and shapes of stress spectra. While most of the prediction equations overestimate the moments of the two selected types of ranges, the equation provided by Dirlik is shown to have the best fit with respect to the simulated rainflow ranges. Naboishikov's formula proves to be the most accurate predictor for the local ranges whenever the irregularity factor $\alpha$ is larger than 0.6. {\textcopyright} 1993.},

To shorten these testing times an accelerated vibration-testing approach is usually applied. This research tries to shorten these testing times by considering the parameters that define vibration-testing techniques. With special attention to the excitation types sweep-sine and random, a damage-based approach is applied. The phenomenon of fatigue damage is closely observed from the frequency-domain point of view but also by considering the relationship between the time and the frequency domains. The Palmgren-Miner cumulative rule is applied to calculate the fatigue life. Two case studies of measured responses are used to compare the times to failure. The results show that proposed predictions can be used to compare different testing techniques, but they are not so accurate when predicting the actual times to failure.},

KGaA, Weinheim Spectral methods use analytical expressions to estimate the fatigue damage in vibrating structures subjected to uniaxial or multiaxial random stresses. They exploit the random vibration theory which idealizes the random stress as a random process characterized by a power spectral density (PSD) in the frequency-domain. The random process is hypothesized to be stationary or non-stationary, Gaussian or non-Gaussian, and with narrow-band or wide-band power spectral density. The accuracy of analytical spectral solutions depends on whether such hypotheses are fulfilled by actual random time-histories encountered in practice. Knowing the range of applicability of each spectral method is then of utmost importance to avoid estimation errors. After a short account on the frequency-domain description of random processes, this paper presents a brief survey on selected spectral methods for uniaxial and multiaxial random loading. It then analyzes when the hypotheses behind each spectral method are not verified in reality, with the purpose to provide recommendations for a safe use of frequency-based methods.},

The critical plane orientation is here proposed to depend on the Power Spectral Density (PSD) matrix of the stress tensor. Then, the PSD function of an equivalent normal stress is defined by considering a linear combination of the PSD functions of the normal stress and the projected shear stress along the direction of maximum variance, with such stresses acting on the critical plane. Such an equivalent PSD function allows us to apply the Tovo-Benasciutti method to estimate the fatigue life of the structural components.

The fatigue limits under plane bending and torsional stresses, also under five combinations of these stresses, have been determined ; in addition a series of static and other supplementary tests have been made. The results of the combined stress fatigue tests obtained with the ductile steels can be expressed by a simple relation fa/fl2fq2/q,*=1, where f and q refer, respectively, to the applied bending and torsional stresses a t the fatigue limit of the combination, while f, and q, denote respectively the fatigue limits under simple bending and pure shear. Further experiments on a wide range of other steels are in hand; in the meantime probably little error is involved in assuming the general application to ductile metals and alloys of the above equation, which should be found useful in the design of engineering components subjected to a combination of alternating bending and twisting moments.

Today, some piezoelectric fatigue machines are very reliable, capable of producing 10(10) cycles in less than 1 week.

@article{kovarik2016fatigue,
abstract = {Many applications of thermally sprayed coatings call for increased fatigue resistance of coated parts. Despite the intensive research in this area, the influence of coating on fatigue is still not completely understood. In this paper, the localization of crack initiation sites and the dynamics of crack propagation are studied. The resonance bending fatigue test was employed to test flat specimens with both sides coated. Hastelloy-X substrates coated with classical thermal barrier coating consisting of yttria stabilized zirconia and NiCoCrAlY layers. The strain distribution on the coating surface was evaluated by the Digital Image Correlation method through the whole duration of the fatigue test. Localization of crack initiation sites and the mode of crack propagation in the coated specimen are related to the observed resonance frequency. The individual phases of specimen degradation, i.e., the changes of material properties, crack initiation, and crack propagation, were identified. The tested coatings strongly influenced the first two phases, and the influence on the crack propagation was less significant. In general, the presented crack detection method can be used as a sensitive nondestructive testing method well suited for coated parts.},

abstract = {The paper contains a new algorithm for estimation of fatigue life in HCF regime under multiaxial random loading using spectral methods. Loading of Gaussian distribution and narrow- and broad-band frequency spectra were assumed. Various characteristic states of multiaxial loading were considered. The equivalent stress history was determined with use of the failure criteria of multiaxial fatigue based on the critical plane. For determination of the critical plane position, the method of variance was applied. During simulation, the authors compared the results obtained by a spectral method in the frequency domain with those from the rain-flow algorithm in the time domain. The paper also contains the results of fatigue tests for 18G2A structural steel subjected to bending and combined bending with torsion. The tests were performed in order to verify the proposed algorithms for determination of fatigue life. It has been shown that under multiaxial random loading results of fatigue life calculated according to the considered algorithms in frequency and time domains are well correlated with the results of experiments.},

abstract = {Fatigue crack initiates in the slip band and exists also in it near fatigue limit; many slip bands are apt to appear in the direction of the maximum shearing stress; crack propagates by the normal tensile stress; the maximum shearing stress on a plane at fatigue limit is reduced by the effect of the normal stress on the same plane. From these results of the experiment, a new criterion is proposed, which coincides with the Gough's empirical formula for the brittle materials under combined stress. As the plane of the maximum shearing stress is varied by the various combination of torsion and bending, the isotropic material should be used in the combined stress experiment.

@article{Jiang_experimental_design,
abstract = {Novel accelerated random vibration fatigue test methodology and strategy are proposed, which can generate a design of the experimental test plan significantly reducing the test time and the sample size. Based on theoretical analysis and fatigue damage model, several groups of random vibration fatigue tests were designed and conducted with the aim of investigating effects of both Gaussian and non-Gaussian random excitation on the vibration fatigue. First, stress responses at a weak point of a notched specimen structure were measured under different base random excitations. According to the measured stress responses, the structural fatigue lives corresponding to the different vibrational excitations were predicted by using the WAFO simulation technique. Second, a couple of destructive vibration fatigue tests were carried out to validate the accuracy of the WAFO fatigue life prediction method. After applying the proposed experimental and numerical simulation methods, various factors that affect the vibration fatigue life of structures were systematically studied, including root mean squares of acceleration, power spectral density, power spectral bandwidth, and kurtosis. The feasibility of WAFO for non-Gaussian vibration fatigue life prediction and the use of non-Gaussian vibration excitation for accelerated fatigue testing were experimentally verified.},

@article{wolfsteiner_rail_vehicle,
abstract = {The assessment of fatigue load under random vibrations is usually based on load spectra. Typically they are computed with counting methods (e.g. Rainflow) based on a time domain signal. Alternatively methods are available (e.g. Dirlik) enabling the estimation of load spectra directly from power spectral densities (PSDs) of the corresponding time signals; the knowledge of the time signal is then not necessary. These PSD based methods have the enormous advantage that if for example the signal to assess results from a finite element method based vibration analysis, the computation time of the simulation of PSDs in the frequency domain outmatches by far the simulation of time signals in the time domain. This is especially true for random vibrations with very long signals in the time domain. The disadvantage of the PSD based simulation of vibrations and also the PSD based load spectra estimation is their limitation to Gaussian distributed time signals. Deviations from this Gaussian distribution cause relevant deviations in the estimated load spectra. In these cases usually only computation time intensive time domain calculations produce accurate results. This paper presents a method dealing with non-Gaussian signals with real statistical properties that is still able to use the efficient PSD approach with its computation time advantages. Essentially it is based on a decomposition of the non-Gaussian signal in Gaussian distributed parts. The PSDs of these rearranged signals are then used to perform usual PSD analyses. In particular, detailed methods are described for the decomposition of time signals and the derivation of PSDs and cross power spectral densities (CPSDs) from multiple real measurements without using inaccurate standard procedures. Furthermore the basic intention is to design a general and integrated method that is not just able to analyse a certain single load case for a small time interval, but to generate representative PSD and CPSD spectra replacing extensive measured loads in time domain without losing the necessary accuracy for the fatigue load results. These long measurements may even represent the whole application range of the railway vehicle. The presented work demonstrates the application of this method to railway vehicle components subjected to random vibrations caused by the wheel rail contact. Extensive measurements of axle box accelerations have been used to verify the proposed procedure for this class of railway vehicle applications. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{zheng2017probability,
abstract = {An inverse system method for multi-input multi-output stationary non-Gaussian random vibration test is proposed in the paper to control the response characteristics both in time-domain and frequency-domain simultaneously. Hence, the control objectives are not only the traditional response power spectral densities but also probability distributions. The control of the probability distributions is more comprehensive and reasonable than the control of kurtoses in order to duplicate the time-domain characteristics of the measured data because kurtoses provide only partial behaviors of the probability distributions. The nonlinear transformation process is introduced to generate non-Gaussian random signals with specified probability distributions. To obtain the desired vibration environments for the test, the reference response signals are synthesized first by the reference spectra and probability distributions, and then the coupled drive signals are generated via the inverse system in the time domain. The close loop correction algorithms are implemented to update the drive signals, actually to update the reference response signals according to the deviations between the references and the measured responses. Finally, a numerical example by a cantilever beam and a biaxial vibration test are carried out and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed method.},

Such stress spectral densities are often experienced by chassis and suspension components of road vehicles. Some of the methods for predicting fatigue damage using frequency-domain statistics of random stress processes are reviewed. A new `bi-modal' model is devised for calculating the probability density function of stress ranges in the case of a spectral density with two peaks. The method has the attraction of converging to the same results as the well known Rayleigh distribution for narrow band processes, if either of the spectral peaks is small. A component in a heavy road vehicle suspension is used as a case study. Sensitivity analyses are conducted to compare the new method with various other frequency-domain approaches, and with the widely accepted rain-flow method of cycle counting in the time domain.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS Transverse strength, maximum deflection, and modulus of elasticity of glass fiber-reinforced polymethyl methacrylate acrylic resin were studied with a 3-point load test on 54 intact specimens. Six concentrations of type B glass fiber specimens were prepared (n = 9 per each fiber group). Fractured joint margins were rounded, a 2-mm gap was placed between them, and then they were repaired with autopolymerizing acrylic resin and retested. RESULTS Transverse strength, maximum deflection, and the stiffness of all joints were significantly lower after the repair. Among the groups tested, the units treated with 1{\%} glass fiber displayed the highest transverse strength before and after repair. Modulus of elasticity of the repaired 1{\%} fiber concentration units was enhanced by approximately 25{\%} over those repaired but untreated with glass fiber (0{\%} fiber).},

@article{kovarik_resonance_bending,
abstract = {The use of specimen loss factor as fatigue damage indicator of Hastelloy-X substrates with different surface treatments was investigated together with other fatigue damage indicators, namely resonance frequency and crack mouth length. The tested surface treatments included grit-blasting and plasma spraying of NiCoCrAlY bond coat and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) top coat. The loss factors of fatigue test specimens were measured repeatedly during the resonance bending fatigue test using the conventional free decay method. The analysis of the damping spectra, i.e. the model describing the relation of loss factor to maximum macroscopic specimen strain $\epsilon$yywas drafted. The model is based on the combination of defect models developed by G{\"{o}}ken and Riehemann (2004) and classical dislocation model of Granato and L{\"{u}}cke (1956). It appears, that the damping spectra can be well approximated as a combination of two defect peaks (C1and C2) and one dislocation peak (D1). The low strain defect peak (peak C1) is sensitive to the presence of fatigue cracks. The second defect peak (peak C2) can be attributed to the remaining substrate and coating defects such as embedded grit particles, coating porosity, surface roughness and sliding in the sample clamping area. The fatigue damage detection using the C1peak magnitude was performed and its results were related to the crack length obtained by digital image correlation (DIC) method. In the crack initiation stage I., the C1peak height shows different behavior than the resonance frequency and therefore provides new information. The underlying processes causing C1peak changes need to be found yet, however. In the crack growth stage II., both resonance frequency and peak height C1correlate with the measured fatigue crack size.},

abstract = {Ultrasonic metal welding is widely used for joining multiple layers of dissimilar metals, such as aluminum/copper battery tabs welding onto copper busbars. It is therefore important to have a robust product/process design using ultrasonic metal welding that ensures consistent welds with desired quality. In this work, the effects of longitudinal and flexural vibrations of the battery tab during ultrasonic welding on the development of axial normal stresses that occasionally cause cracks near the weld area are studied by applying a one-dimensional continuous vibration model for the battery tab. Analysis results indicate that fracture could occur near the weld area, due to low cycle fatigue as a result of large dynamic stresses induced by resonant flexural vibration of the battery tab during welding. This study provides a fundamental understanding of battery tab dynamics during ultrasonic welding and its effects on weld quality, and can be used to develop guidelines for product/process design of ultrasonically welded battery tabs.

The proposed procedure assumes to know the fatigue damage induced by Gaussian equivalent stress state time domain process. This characteristic allows the proposed procedure to be easily adopted inside the so-called Frequency Domain Fatigue Methods but in parallel with the statistical analysis of the system time domain response (Kurtosis and Skewness evaluation).

The concern of the Grayloc nut getting loosened in the absence of a lock nut due to flow induced vibration and the resulting fretting in the feeder pipes in contact due to differential creep in the neighbouring channels has been addressed here. The severity of the test was decided based on actual site measurement under different operating flow conditions and comparison of power spectral density (PSD). The laboratory test results were extrapolated for estimation of life of the component under operating condition using inverse power law approach. The uniqueness of the accelerated test is that the component under test has not been led to failure for assessing its operating life unlike conventional accelerated testing. From the tests and analysis, it was deduced that 80 h of accelerated laboratory testing was equivalent to 5.26 full power years (46,080 h) of the reactor operating life. The test duration was enough to obtain approval from the regulatory body to operate the reactor.},

abstract = {Fatigue strength of a type A319 cast aluminium alloy was studied by means of fully reversible tension-compression tests conducted at room temperature and at 130 °C; the specimens used in this study came from samples cut from the bulkheads of V-8 type engine blocks. Testing was carried out in a servohydraulic machine following staircase schedules. The specimens were tested to fracture or up to 107cycles. Analyses of the fatigue tests yield to a strength of 99.4 and 90.3 MPa at 107cycles for the tests at room temperature and at 130 °C. The size and nature of the defects that originated the failure were determined by scanning electron microscopy. It was found that fatigue cracks originated in pores; single cracks were observed to occur in samples tested below a nominal reversible stress of 120 MPa; multiple cracks were observed in samples stressed above this value. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The evaluation of the fatigue behavior of mechanical systems and components subjected to random loads is increasingly being addressed to the frequency domain environment both in terms of dynamic analysis and in terms of results post-processing. The procedure set out in the paper (bands method) is formulated without assumptions about the shape of the Power Spectral Density (PSD) function to be analyzed, in order to obtain a criterion that can be applied to any typology of the related random process. The basic idea of the proposed approach is that each PSD function can be divided into frequency bands, for each of them a Rayleigh distribution could be associated and that the aforementioned distributions could be opportunely combined to obtain the actual damage. The method is theoretically developed and numerically validated on a particular subset of PSD functions by comparing the results obtained with those carried out by the time domain damage evaluation reference method and a frequency domain direct approach (Dirlik's method). With regard to the time domain reference criterion the stress time histories are generated by the indirect method (a previously defined authors' method), the cycles spectra are obtained by Rain Flow Counting, (RFC) and the damage is evaluated by Palmgren-Miner's rule.},

These curves are obtained thanks to a vibrational fatigue bench composed of an electrodynamic shaker and a closed loop vibration control system.

Three criteria based on strain gauge measurements are implemented to provide cycle numbers to failure N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}f{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and to plot the fatigue curves. Furthermore, cycle numbers to failure are also assessed from two modal parameters (resonant frequency and loss damping factor) and compared with the results obtained from these three criteria.

abstract = {The prediction of fatigue damage under random loading is usually based on Miner's rule combined with the rainflow cycle counting method. However, the process of counting cycles is extremely time consuming and requires a reasonably long time history to be analysed for the results to be reliable. This paper describes a model for the probability distribution of the rainflow stress range based on a mixed-distribution Weibull model whose parameters can be evaluated from only two spectral properties, namely the irregularity factor I and a bandwidth parameter $\beta$0.75. Comparison of the probability distribution function (PDF) of the stress range based on the model with results from simulation and rainflow counting shows very good agreement over a wide range of stress spectra. In addition, comparisons have been made in terms of the damage correction factor. These show that the model gives a better assessment of damage than any previous model within the practical range of the Paris' parameter m for steel. This model may therefore be used in place of rainflow counting and hence provides an efficient and accurate tool for the prediction of fatigue under random loading. {\textcopyright} 1992.},

The stationarity of the input excitation is one of the fundamental assumptions required for frequency-domain fatigue-damage theory. However, for real applications, excitation is frequently non-stationary and the identification of this non-stationarity is not easy. This study researches run-tests to identify the index of non-stationarity. Further, using excitation signals with different rates of amplitude-modulated non-stationarity, the index of non-stationarity is experimentally and theoretically researched with regards to the fatigue life. The experimental research was performed on a flexible structure that was excited close to a natural frequency. The experimental fatigue life is compared to the theoretical fatigue life under the stationarity assumption. The analysis of the experimental results reveals a close relation between the identified non-stationarity in the excitation signal and the fatigue life of the structure. It was found that amplitude-modulated non-stationary excitation results in a significantly shorter fatigue life if compared to a similar level of stationary excitation.},

abstract = {In vibration fatigue, flexible structures operate at or close to their natural frequencies. Therefore, it is common to consider the input excitation as well as the stress/strain response of the structure to be Gaussian and stationary. In reality, a non-Gaussian and non-stationary excitation is frequently observed, resulting in a possibly non-Gaussian and non-stationary response. The importance of this non-Gaussianity (typically observed via the kurtosis) has resulted in significant research on the relevance of the Gaussian assumption in fatigue life. For dynamic structures the prior research was mainly theoretically and numerically focused. This work researches the importance of non-Gaussianity and non-stationarity theoretically, numerically and experimentally. Y-shaped specimens were used in this research. The excitation close to the natural frequency is random and in all the researched cases with the same power spectral density (PSD). While the PSD was kept the same, the rate of non-Gaussianity and the non-stationarity were changed. The results show that when the excitation is stationary and non-Gaussian, the fatigue life is not significantly impacted, and that standard frequency-counting methods are applicable. However, for the case of a non-stationary, non-Gaussian excitation, the fatigue life was found to be significantly impacted and the Gaussian theoretical approach is questionable.},

@article{Proso_non_linear,
abstract = {Structural damage in mechanical components is frequently caused by high-cycle vibration fatigue. The non-linearities, frequently observed in real structures at increased excitation levels, significantly influence the damage accumulation. As the modal analysis bases on linear theory, the non-linearities are hard to include. Based on a new experimental identification of the non-linearities, this research proposes the corrected linear damage-accumulation estimation. With the proposed correction, the linear modal analysis is used for damage estimation of structures with non-linearities. The proposed approach is applied to a real-life case of steel-sheet attached with rivets. Several samples are exposed to an accelerated vibration-fatigue test with increasing and also decreasing excitation levels. It is shown that with the experimentally identified non-linearity correction, the numerical fatigue life-time was within the 10{\%} of the experimentally identified life-time. Experimentally, it was shown that rivets same by design, but produced by different manufacturers, have a significant difference in the fatigue life-time; this difference was clearly identified with the proposed correction to the linear damage-accumulation estimation. Further, the frequency response function based identification of the non-linearity can be identified before the structure is exposed to fatigue loads resulting in new possibilities of vibration-fatigue analysis of non-linear systems.},

This research introduces a theoretical approach to damping-layout design (location and size) with frequency-content control. Initially, the frequency-response functions (measured or simulated) are modified to obtain the required damping layout via spatial-damping identification methods. The use of these methods provides a straightforward relationship between the frequency responses and the targeted spatial damping. The Lee–Kim spatial-damping identification method is used in the presented numerical and experimental case studies. The numerical and experimental results show that the approach is capable of providing the desired frequency content. This approach can be a valuable tool for a damping-layout assessment as high damping can be achieved with a reduced amount of damping material in a single-step solution.},

@article{Mrsnik_Slavic_Boltezar_fatigue_decomposition,
abstract = {Vibration-fatigue analysis deals with the material fatigue of flexible structures operating close to natural frequencies. Based on the uniaxial stress response, calculated in the frequency domain, the high-cycle fatigue model using the S-N curve material data and the Palmgren-Miner hypothesis of damage accumulation is applied. The multiaxial criterion is used to obtain the equivalent uniaxial stress response followed by the spectral moment approach to the cycle-amplitude probability density estimation. The vibration-fatigue analysis relates the fatigue analysis in the frequency domain to the structural dynamics. However, once the stress response within a node is obtained, the physical model of the structure dictating that response is discarded and does not propagate through the fatigue-analysis procedure. The structural model can be used to evaluate how specific dynamic properties (e.g., damping, modal shapes) affect the damage intensity. A new approach based on modal decomposition is presented in this research that directly links the fatigue-damage intensity with the dynamic properties of the system. It thus offers a valuable insight into how different modes of vibration contribute to the total damage to the material. A numerical study was performed showing good agreement between results obtained using the newly presented approach with those obtained using the classical method, especially with regards to the distribution of damage intensity and critical point location. The presented approach also offers orders of magnitude faster calculation in comparison with the conventional procedure. Furthermore, it can be applied in a straightforward way to strain experimental modal analysis results, taking advantage of experimentally measured strains.},

@article{Wolfsteiner_non_stationary_gaussian,
abstract = {This paper presents a method for determining the decomposition of a non-stationary, random vibration with a non-Gaussian distribution into several stationary portions with Gaussian distributions. The fatigue load of the initial non-stationary signal, and the summarized fatigue loads of the derived Gaussian portions are identical in both a direct comparison and in a comparison of the vibration responses caused by these signals on an arbitrary linear dynamical system. As stationary Gaussian signals can be described by power spectral densities (PSD), the analysis of the dynamical response with its corresponding fatigue load can be switched from time domain to frequency domain with an enormous performance gain regarding numerical computations. Especially, a combination of a realistic non-stationary signal with a large duration (from measurements), together with huge structural dynamics models is hard to analyze numerically in time domain because of enormous computation times. The proposed PSD-based method enables a very efficient numerical analysis in frequency domain. For the estimation of load spectra in frequency domain, well established PSD-based methods can be used, corresponding to Rainflow counting in time domain. This paper gives a detailed introduction to the procedure outlined with associated equations necessary for a numerical solution. The correct modeling of the fatigue damage load is proven by applying the fatigue damage spectrum concept.},

abstract = {A frequency domain approach to fatigue life evaluation is an important task in the design of mechanical components subject to random loads. The greatest advantages of this method are the computational efficiency and the capability to give a synthetic representation of a random process. The importance of this method is clear, especially when it is used in the postprocessing phase of a numerical analysis, for example Finite Element (FEA) or Multibody (MBS) simulation. The weak step in this procedure is the direct evaluation of the probability density function (pdf) of the cycles amplitude from stress power spectral density (PSD). In fact, the translation to frequency domain of the Rainflow cycle counting is a serious problem but there is a body of important literature concerning this. After reviewing the most important literature from this research field, a new original index to compare the reliability of the frequency domain methods is proposed. This index efficiently achieves this purpose, and a future objective could be to use such index to define a correction factor in order to exactly evaluate the fatigue damage. A very important class of random processes was considered: the bimodal power spectral density (PSD) random processes. The aim of this paper is to identify independent parameters in these processes and through them evaluate the cycles probability density function (pdf) amplitude. {\textcopyright} 2004 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to perform an accelerated vibration-based fatigue test these changes must be taken into account in order to maintain constant-stress loading. This paper presents an improved accelerated fatigue-testing methodology based on the dynamic response of the test specimen to the harmonic excitation in the near-resonant area with simultaneous monitoring of the modal parameters. The measurements of the phase angle and the stress amplitude in the fatigue zone are used for the real-time adjustment of the excitation signal according to the changes in the specimens modal parameters. The presented methodology ensures a constant load level throughout the fatigue process until the final failure occurs. With the proposed testing methodology it is possible to obtain a S-N point of the Woehler curve relatively quickly and to simultaneously monitor the changes of the specimens natural frequency and damping loss factor. The presented methodology with real-time control is verified on an aluminum Y-shaped specimen (106load cycles are achieved in 21 min) and is applicable to a specimen with arbitrary geometry. Besides the faster completion of the fatigue test the methodology can be adopted for the validation of the vibrational fatigue analysis. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {© 2017 ACM. There is an increasing interest in learning outside of the traditional classroom setting. This is especially true for topics covering computational tools and data science, as both are challenging to incorporate in the standard curriculum. These atypical learning environments offer new opportunities for teaching, particularly when it comes to combining conceptual knowledge with hands-on experience/expertise with methods and skills. Advances in cloud computing and containerized environments provide an attractive opportunity to improve the effciency and ease with which students can learn. This manuscript details recent advances towards using commonly-Available cloud computing services and advanced cyberinfrastructure support for improving the learning experience in bootcamp-style events. We cover the benets (and challenges) of using a server hosted remotely instead of relying on student laptops, discuss the technology that was used in order to make this possible, and give suggestions for how others could implement and improve upon this model for pedagogy and reproducibility.},

	abstract = {© 2017 Holdgraf, Rieger, Micheli, Martin, Knight and Theunissen. Cognitive neuroscience has seen rapid growth in the size and complexity of data recorded from the human brain as well as in the computational tools available to analyze this data. This data explosion has resulted in an increased use of multivariate, model-based methods for asking neuroscience questions, allowing scientists to investigate multiple hypotheses with a single dataset, to use complex, time-varying stimuli, and to study the human brain under more naturalistic conditions. These tools come in the form of “Encoding” models, in which stimulus features are used to model brain activity, and “Decoding” models, in which neural features are used to generated a stimulus output. Here we review the current state of encoding and decoding models in cognitive electrophysiology and provide a practical guide toward conducting experiments and analyses in this emerging field. Our examples focus on using linear models in the study of human language and audition. We show how to calculate auditory receptive fields from natural sounds as well as how to decode neural recordings to predict speech. The paper aims to be a useful tutorial to these approaches, and a practical introduction to using machine learning and applied statistics to build models of neural activity. The data analytic approaches we discuss may also be applied to other sensory modalities, motor systems, and cognitive systems, and we cover some examples in these areas. In addition, a collection of Jupyter notebooks is publicly available as a complement to the material covered in this paper, providing code examples and tutorials for predictive modeling in python. The aimis to provide a practical understanding of predictivemodeling of human brain data and to propose best-practices in conducting these analyses.},
