    "Signal processing deals with the analysis of processes which can in general be **deterministic** or **random**\\index{process!deterministic}\\index{process!random}. Deterministic process is the process that can (with a reasonable accuracy) be described with an explicit mathematical relation. Random process is a process than cannot be described with an explicit mathematical relation, but requires probability statements and statistical averages.\n",

    "Deterministic data from a deterministic process\\index{data!deterministic} is that which can be unambiguously deduced through mathematical relationships and conditions. Values within the sequence, such as a time history\\index{time history}, can be successfully extrapolated or predicted, to at least within the tolerable error margin. When considering for instance the measured data from a deterministic dynamic system it is expected that, under equal conditions, the observed repeated system response will always be equal, as is, for example, for a mathematical pendulum, released from the same height.\n"
